### Results

The UW Resilience Lab Sign's project originally stemmed in our interest in the UW Resilience Lab Sign memes where students created images that made fun of the signs, thus we were interested in whether or not the sign's intervention was effective in achieving the intentional purpose that the researcher had. To evaluate the effectiveness of the signs, we created and distributed a survey and analyzed the results. We asked students about their percieved effectiveness of the signs, how they felt after the signs (discouraged or uplifted), and whether the sign exposure initiated any behavior changes. 

In the first question of our survey, we asked students to name one word that came to mind for one of the sign's messages. For each word, we ran a sentiment analysis to determine whether students had a negative or positive response to the sign on average, yet the results reveal that students had a neutral response to the sign. 

When analyzing the student's percieved effectiveness of the signs, a majority of the students regardless of the year in school or ethnicity reported that the signs were ineffective or neither ineffective/effective. Although interestingly, we noticed that a majority of students pursuing STEM majors reported that the signs were ineffective while a majority students pursuing non-STEM majors reported that the intervention was neither ineffective/effective. Though a likely reason for these results was that our sample consisted of more students pursuing STEM majors than not. 

When evaluating the changes in behavior of students after being exposed to the signs, a majority of students reported not having a behavior change at all due to the signs. For the small few who did respond that their behavior did change, they essentially reported the signs impacting their mood and serving as a reminder to them to place their life in perspective or to remind them to be positive. This is significant because while a majority responded that the signs were ineffective or did not change their behavior, this does not mean that the signs did not make an impact in an individual's life. 

The qualitative data pertaining to specifically what individuals discussed about the signs was interesting because students mainly talked about the sign memes or the hilarity of the signs. Some students mentioned how negative the signs were because it was a reminder/trigger of their negative times at the university, or they saw the signs and read them in a condescending/sarcastic manner. In general, students discussed about the negative effect the signs had, but it was also a shared topic the university students could share and laugh about. We argue that while it was a trigger for students and had a negative impact, it did, momentarily, connect individuals together and relief stress. On the other hand, Positive remarks about the signs were minimal and insiginificant.

To determine the effectiveness of the signs in spreading compassion, we asked about how uplifted individuals felt after being exposed to the signs which a majority of the respondents answered "not uplifted at all." We additionally asked whether or not students felt discouraged because of the signs. If a majority of students answered "yes" to this question, the signs would be deemed as having the opposite effect then intended. Though for the discouraged question, a majority of the individuals reported the signs being "not discouraging at all." Overall this reveals that the signs had not made an impact in how individuals felt; it neither encourage or discourage them.

To delve deeper into the results of our data, we wanted to see whether or not the reported uplifted results or how students percieved the effectiveness of the signs was correlated with a variable such as self-reported mental health. This is because we predicted that an individual with a self-reported lower mental health rating would be impacted more by the signs than those who self-reported having better mental health. In both cases, there was not a correlation thus the student's mental health is not related to how uplifted a student felt being exposed to the signs or the report effectiveness of the signs.

### Conclusion

In evaluating the effectiveness of the UW Resilience lab sign's "to promote compassion on campus" and "combat microaggression with microcompassion." We evaluated how students were impacted overall by asking about their emotional response after being exposed to the signs and how effective they believe that the intervention was. Though collectively, our results suggest that students had a neutral or negative response to the signs. Students did not feel encouraged or discouraged by the signs, and it did not impact them to change their behavior. The sentimental analysis we performed is evidence that the students had a neutral response to the signs. Although the results for the sentimental analysis are likely due to the methods we used to attain the data. More specifically, it is possibly that the students did not have enough time to think about the word or using a one word answer was not the best method to determine their response. 

When asking students directly how effective they felt that the sign intervention was at promoting compassion on campus, a majority students responded that the signs were not effective and neither effective/not effective. Collectively, the results suggest that the the UW Resilience lab signs were ineffective in achieving its goals to promote compassion on campus. Instead we argue that the results reveal that instead the signs acted as a topic that individuals discussed to relieve stress and satirically joke about. The results also reveal that while there was not a holistic positive impact on every student on campus, for some it did majorly uplift their day. We suggest that ___

### Future Development
There were several limitations to this research project. One major limitation was attaining a large sample representative of the University of Washington population. Our sample for this research project was 150 individuals which is drastically smaller than the population size. Our sample was additionally not representative of the populations demographics because we did not apply stratified sampling and overall the sample was attained by convenience sampling as well. We attained our sample with an online survey and asked our friends/classmates who attended UW to take the survey which biases the sample to only individuals we know or have interacted with some way. Additionally, there are some individuals not represented in our sample such as international students, hispanics/latinos, and several various majors on campus. Due to this limitation we would be unable to draw conclusive results from this research project.

To improve this research project in the future, we should attain a sample that is randomly attained with stratified sampling. Therefore our sample would be representative of the population's race, year in school, and majors. In doing so, we would be able to draw conclusions (while not conclusive) from a sample that is representative of the population. Additionally, to improve this research project in the future, we would ask more questions related to the first question centered on recieving people's first response to the sign's messages. For example, we would ask questions about how effective the sign's message of "You Matter" and "Don't Give Up" were by asking the student's the first word they thought of as well as how uplifted or discouraged they felt. By asking students more questions about each specific message, we would be able to attain data on messages that were most effective overall.
