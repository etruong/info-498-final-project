Memes make them look bad,They seem to leave people more bitter than anything,I encouraged them to do a project about them,"Talked about how they can make you reassess how well you are doing, but sometimes in a way that makes you want to think about all of the issues you're facing and not bringin' in the positivity",We talked about how they were kind of funny,Look at this sign. ,I was more optimistic,Negative
I talked about the memes they created,...they're naive and unhelpful ,Told my parents about them and how cool they are,"I discussed how most of the signs were encouraging, but some trigger negative parts of my experience at UW",Jokes,If they had noticed the signs,I became friendlier afterwards because I was in a better mood.,It didn't
Memes,"That UW, should instead start talking to more people and making mental health resources more readily available rather than this stuff. They have ruined what the meaning of learning is. If they focused on making better classes and removed the GPA, I can promise you that students would perform much better in each class. ",I said that I really appreciated the folks who put them up! They're often very timely,,People have joked about them,Contracting to the institution's systems and culture,I might of smiled and felt encouraged/inspired for a moment,No
If it seemed meme-able or affirmatively against my daily experience. ,"How hypocritical they seem, because UW just wants our sweet sweet money and doesn't actually give a hoot about the individual",i liked them ,,It was in a joking/ironic manner,Just critiqued them,Mood changed from bad to good,i feel either roll eyes or feel bad
"That they were featured on the UW Meme page, and how they tended to have the opposite effect than originally hoped by the creators",Hey you see those dumb signs? É,,,Funny,Wow that's pretty straight-forward. ,I think seeing them often might help change my thought patterns about myself ,No 
"""Did you see the memes about the signs?""",,,,"That they were funny. I thought it was a prank at first, to be honest.",They're interesting,The rest of my walk to class was with a smile.,I don't think it changed.
"I talked about how the signs are getting ruined by the memes. I thought they were really positive, but it happens.",,,,I hope people don't make fun of these.,,They reminded me to stop worrying. ,Minimal Change
,,,,,,I was happy,
,,,,,,More positive attitudes,
,,,,,,I had a more positive outlook throughout my day ,
,,,,,,"I kept at the school grind, so my behavior didn't change, but my mindset did. It was like a little boost to my day!",
,,,,,,i remember to think of something im grateful for. it helps me think in a bigger picture instead of stressing the small stuff,
,,,,,,Trying to focus less on my reactions and focus more on intentions,
